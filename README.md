# CORS Proxy

This simple Node.js-based proxy allows your JavaScript application to call services that are hosted on a different domain and that don't support [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). 

Because the proxy is itself CORS-enabled, your application and the proxy don't have to be hosted on the same 
domain.

This proxy was tested with the Salesforce.com REST API, but it should work with other services as well.

## Installation

There are different options to get your own instance of the CORS proxy up and running:

1. Deploy to Heroku (easiest): click the 'Deploy to Heroku' button at the top of this page

1. Install a local version
    - Clone this repository
    - Install the server dependencies
    
        ```
        npm install
        ```
    
    - Start the server
         
         ```
         npm start
         ```
2. To run with Typescript
     - Intall typescript
        ```
        npm install -g typescript
        ```
     - Install the server dependencies
       ```
        npm install
        ```
     - Compile typescipt 
        ```
        npm run compile
        ```
     - Start the server
        ```
        npm run start-ts
        ```
          
## Usage

When making an API call using JavaScript (using XMLHTTPRequest, $.ajax, etc):

1. Substitute the actual service URL with the Proxy URL 

1. Set the request method, query parameters, and body as usual

1. Set the actual service URL in a header named 'Target-URL'

1. Send the request as usual


## CORS Headers

The proxy allows **all** origins, methods, and headers. You probably want to lock this down in a production 
environment.


## Other Headers

The proxy currently passes the "Authorization" header to the target endpoint. You can modify the proxy to pass
 additional headers (or all of them).
